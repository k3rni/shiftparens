A prototype reimplementation of the shift-parenthesis concept, in Python.

Uses parts of uinputmapper (to read from event devices), but that might be replaced with libevdev someday. 
Needs `xdotool` (install it from your distribution's repositories, and again, might be replaced with libxdo). 
Other than that, no external dependencies.

Similar projects: xcape, keydouble, actkbd, python-uinput.

To run:

1. check out the code
2. check out uinputmapper somewhere
3. run `make` in uinputmapper's root, to generate the symbols file
4. from that place, copy the uinputmapper directory to shiftparens.
5. check which device in `/dev/input` is your keyboard, replace hardcoded /dev/input/event3 with the correct path
6. run as root (or setup your input devices with proper permissions, I don't care)

Usage:

By default there are 5 mappings:

* press and release LeftShift: `(`
* press and release RightShift: `)`
* first LeftShift then RightShift (released in either order): `()`
* first RightShift then LeftShift: `)(`
* press and release LeftCtrl: equivalent to pressing ESC
